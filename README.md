# Economic Analysis of U.S. Elections

This repository contains an analysis of the relationship between economic indicators—such as inflation, unemployment rates, and GDP growth—and their impact on U.S. elections. The goal of this project is to explore how these economic figures influence voter behavior and election outcomes.

This project examines historical economic data in relation to U.S. election results to determine if there are significant correlations between economic conditions and electoral outcomes. By analyzing trends and patterns, we aim to provide insights into how economic factors may sway voter decisions.
